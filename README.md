# PyFitnessPal

PyFitnessPal is based off of MyFitnessPal, but has a focus on nutrition rather than weight loss. It also has a few additional features and a punnier name.

PyFitnessPal is written using Python 3, MySQL, Flask, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

PyFitnessPal also makes use of the U.S. Department of Agriculture food composition data through its [API](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/doc/).

### Installation
